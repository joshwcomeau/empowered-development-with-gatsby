# Empowered Development with Gatsby


---

So I built a website for my mom.


import pamWebsiteHero from "./assets/pam-website-hero.png";

<img src={pamWebsiteHero} style={{ minHeight: 583, maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

<SpeakerNote>
  My mom is an artist.
  Built this a few years back with Inferno
</SpeakerNote>

---

It features a list of works:

import pamWebsiteGrid from "./assets/pam-website-grid.png";

<img src={pamWebsiteGrid} style={{ minHeight: 583, maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

This data was sourced from a .js file in the repo:

import pamWebsiteData from "./assets/pam-website-data.png";

<img src={pamWebsiteData} width={628} height={366} />

<SpeakerNote>
  Data is sourced from the filesystem in
</SpeakerNote>

---

### Question

How easy do you think it is for my mom to update this website?

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <li>Unclear structure</li>
    <li>Strict validation</li>
    <li>It's checked into Git</li>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

**High** barrier to entry

---

Wordpress:

import wpUpload from "./assets/wp-upload.gif";

<img src={wpUpload} />

---

**Lower** barrier to entry

---

We always talk about:

- user experience
- developer experience

---

There's another seat at this table though! The _non-technical\*_ people who work on our products.

---

_*non-technical_, in this case, referring to people who build websites but don't call themselves "software developers".

---

Just FYI...

import jqueryVsReact from "./assets/jquery-vs-react.png";

<img src={jqueryVsReact} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />


---

Experience for the **JS-file-in-codebase** approach:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>UX</th>
      <th>DX</th>
      <th>CCX</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <Big>üòÑ</Big>
      </td>
      <td>
        <Big>ü•≥</Big>
      </td>
      <td>
        <Big>üôÅ</Big>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

See also: JSON, MDX, anything that lives in source control.

---

Experience for the **monolithic CMS** approach:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>UX</th>
      <th>DX</th>
      <th>CCX</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <Big>üòê</Big>
      </td>
      <td>
        <Big>üò¨</Big>
      </td>
      <td>
        <Big>üòÑ</Big>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

AKA Wordpress, Squarespace, Shopify, etc

# The Headless CMS

<ul>
  <Appear>
    <div>...was not it.</div>
    <div>...at least, not at first.</div>
  </Appear>
</ul>

---

### What is a headless CMS?

- Structured relational data model
- Friendly admin UI
- Serve data through an API

---

### 1. Structured relational data model

import cmsModel from "./assets/cms-model.png";

<img src={cmsModel} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", height: 430 }} />

---

### 1. Structured relational data model

import cmsRelationships from "./assets/cms-relationships.png";

<img src={cmsRelationships} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", height: 430 }} />

---

### 2. Friendly admin UI

For the gatsbyjs.com site, we use **Contentful**.

---

import contentfulSrc from "./assets/contentful.png";

<img src={contentfulSrc} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

### 3. Serve data through an API



<CodeSnippet
  code={`const AllTheFaqs = () => {
  const { allContentfulFaq } = useStaticQuery(
    graphql\`
      {
        allContentfulFaq(filter: { category: { eq: "Docs" } }) {
          edges {
            node {
              id
              question
              answer {
                html
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    \`
  )
  return (
    <div>
      {allContentfulFaq.edges.map(({ node }) => (
        <FaqCard key={node.id}>
          <FaqCard.Question question={node.question} />
          <FaqCard.Answer answer={node.answer.html} />
        </FaqCard>
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}`}
/>


---

### Pretty cool, right?

Content creators have a friendly UI to update copy...

<Appear>
  <p>But no way to preview it!</p>
</Appear>

---

import jezebel from "./assets/jezebel.png";

<img src={jezebel} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

<Small>
  Jezebel.com
</Small>

---

Content creators need _real-time feedback_, just like developers do.

---

import previewSplash from './assets/preview.jpg';

<img src={previewSplash} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

üîå Gatsby Cloud does this now

---


import previewInCms from './assets/preview-in-cms.png';

<img src={previewInCms} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

It's a _whole site_ preview, not just a _page_ preview.

Stakeholders can check any part of the site or app.

---

It features _hot reload_ with _preserved scroll position_.

Low-latency, real-time feedback.

---

Sanity uses Gatsby Preview to do something pretty amazing

import sanity from './assets/sanity.gif';

<img src={sanity} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

Historically, monolithic tools like Wordpress have been WYSIWYG.

The stuff we build nowadays isn't WYSIGYGable.

---

### A Quick Game

Who does payments better?

Stripe or Wordpress?

---

Who does auth better?

Auth0 or Wordpress?

---

Who does e-commerce better?

Shopify or Wordpress?

---

# The Content Mesh

<!-- By specializing on a particular part of the user experience, companies can deliver better UX. -->

---

import contentMesh from './assets/content-mesh.png';

<img src={contentMesh} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />


---

import nightMarkets from './assets/night-markets.jpg';

<img src={nightMarkets} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

So _in theory_ headless CMS' can do the "CMS" part better than monolithic ones.

---

Live preview is already a big leap forward, but what else can we do?

---

### It's more than copy.

---

# Case Study

### Gatsbyjs.com navigation

---

import dotCom from './assets/dot-com.png';

<img src={dotCom} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

import dotComMenuOpen from './assets/dot-com-menu-open.png';

<img src={dotComMenuOpen} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

import contentfulNav from './assets/contentful-nav.png';

<img src={contentfulNav} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

import contentfulNavDropdown from './assets/contentful-nav-dropdown.png';

<img src={contentfulNavDropdown} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

"Content" is more than copy.

---

React components are building blocks.

Why not empower content creators to use them too?

---

import blocks from './assets/blocks.svg';

<img src={blocks} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---


# Imagine a world

where marketing is empowered to build their own landing pages

---

# Imagine a world

where customer service can build their own resource center

---

# Imagine a world

where developers create platforms, not pages

---

### Not theoretical

Media, deliveries

# Drawbacks

<ul>
<Appear>
  <li>This stuff is pretty bleeding-edge</li>
  <li>Can be more work upfront</li>
  <li>Combinatorial explosion means that design problems may occur</li>
</Appear>
</ul>

# Conclusion

---

"JS Fatigue"?

---

Things are stabilizing

import downloads from './assets/downloads.png'

<img src={downloads} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

Now that things are broadly settled, we can _iterate_ and _improve_.

---

import spiderman from './assets/spiderman.jpg'

<img src={spiderman} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

Thanks!
