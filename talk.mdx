Years ago I built a website for my mom.

import pamWebsiteHero from "./assets/pam-website-hero.png";

<img src={pamWebsiteHero} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

It features a list of works:

import pamWebsiteGrid from "./assets/pam-website-grid.png";

<img src={pamWebsiteGrid} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

---

This data was sourced from a .js file in the repo:

import pamWebsiteData from "./assets/pam-website-data.png";

<img src={pamWebsiteData} />

---

### Question

How easy do you think it is for my mom to update this website?

---

- Weird structure
- The data is in Javascript
- It's checked into Git

---

**High** barrier to entry

---

Wordpress:

import wpUpload from "./assets/wp-upload.gif";

<img src={wpUpload} />

---

**Low** barrier to entry

---

We always talk about:

- user experience
- developer experience

---

There's another seat at this table though! The _non-technical\*_ people who work on our products.

---

_*non-technical_, in this case, referring to people who build websites but don't call themselves "software developers".

---

Just FYI...

import jqueryVsReact from "./assets/jquery-vs-react.png";

<img src={jqueryVsReact} style={{ maxWidth: "80vw", maxHeight: "70vh" }} />

Experience for the **JS-file-in-codebase** approach:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>UX</th>
      <th>DX</th>
      <th>CCX</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <Big>😄</Big>
      </td>
      <td>
        <Big>🥳</Big>
      </td>
      <td>
        <Big>🙁</Big>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

See also: JSON, MDX, anything that lives in source control.

---

Experience for the **monolithic CMS** approach:

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>UX</th>
      <th>DX</th>
      <th>CCX</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <Big>😐</Big>
      </td>
      <td>
        <Big>😬</Big>
      </td>
      <td>
        <Big>😄</Big>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

AKA Wordpress, Squarespace, Shopify, etc

Content creators have a friendly UI to update copy...

...But no way to preview it!
